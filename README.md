Hi ! :)

I would like to emphasize that I had a light background in HTML and CSS since I have built frontend sites in the past, but I have never dealt with React, Express, Nodejs, or Typescript.
The project was very interesting, and I really enjoyed working on it in my free time.
At the beginning, I invested a few hours to understand how the communication between the server and the client is actually carried out - mainly by searching for names of certain functions in Google. 
The first two days were quite challenging, because I also had to understand the syntax of TypeScript. After this, the project really flowed.

And now for technical matters ;) - 

1) As for the sorting - 

from what I understood (seemed to me most logical) the server is dealing with sorting. Each time the client presses the 'sort' button, the server returns a sorted page.
	*One click - ascending order.
	*Second click - descending order. 
	*Third click - original order.

2) Regarding the bonus - 

The feature I decided to add is an option to filter the data by selecting a specific label / several labels.
Once a label is selected - it appears on the page. Multiple labels can be displayed simultaneously. 
You can cancel this action by clicking again on the label when it appears.

3) I assumed that CSS is not the heart of the project, so I made a few additions just for fun :)


Hope I did good :)
I would love to hear from you,
Keren Rachev.
